### Hi there 👋

My name is **Tomas Mikalauskas**, Senior Software Engineer at [disguise](https://www.disguise.one/en/), previously at [Playstation](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/) working in London

I'm *extremely* passionate about all aspects of computer graphics, be it making art, research, designing libraries and tools, or teaching.
